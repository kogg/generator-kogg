having a bunch of generators is fine if its handles the situation
- if we need website-release and website-code instead of having both those in website, its all good

name from specific to general
- heroku-server-release
- codecov-coverage-ci
- website-code[Quality]

naming defines where its called from
- heroku-server-release is called from server-release
- server-release is called from release
- alternatively, heroku-server-release is called from release and there is no server-release
- regardless, release is called from a separate generator

naming defines what options are passed
- heroku-server-release will get the same args as server-release + its own specific args

base-* is used simply for interfaces rather than actual generators
- heroku-server-release might extend base-server-release
